    "\n",
    "## Course Format\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Several computer exercises, 5 compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using [devilry](https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/) to hand in projects and [Git](https://github.com/) for repository and all your material.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Evaluation and grading: The last two projects (4 and 5) count 1/3 of the final mark each  and the  final written exam counts another 1/3 of the final grade. Final written exam December 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The computer lab (room FV329)consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. C/C++ is the default programming language, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and [github address](https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics1) of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as languages.\n",
