      "### A structured programming approach\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Before writing a single line, have the algorithm clarified and understood. It is crucial to have a logical structure of e.g., the flow and organization of data before one starts writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Always try to choose the simplest algorithm. Computational speed can be improved upon later.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Try to write a as clear program as possible. Such programs are easier to debug, and although it may take more time, in the long run it may save you time. If you collaborate with other people, it reduces spending time on debuging and trying to understand what the codes do. A clear program will also allow you to remember better what the program really does!\n",
      "\n",
      "### A structured programming approach\n",
      "\n",
      "  * The planning of the program should be from top down to bottom, trying to keep the flow as linear as possible. Avoid jumping back and forth in the program. First you need to arrange the major tasks to be achieved. Then try to break the major tasks into subtasks. These can be represented by functions or subprograms. They should accomplish limited tasks and as far as possible be independent of each other. That will allow you to use them in other programs as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Try always to find some cases where an analytical solution exists or where simple test cases can be applied. If possible, devise different algorithms for solving the same problem. If you get the same answers, you may have coded things correctly or made the same error twice or more."
