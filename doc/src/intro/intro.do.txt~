===== Lectures and ComputerLab =====

!bblock
  * Lectures: Thursday (8.15am-10am) and Friday (8.15am-10am).
  * Weekly reading assignments needed to solve projects.
  * First hour of each lab session may be used to discuss technicalities, address questions etc linked with projects.
  * Detailed lecture notes, exercises, all programs presented, projects etc can be found at the homepage of the course.
  * Computerlab: Thursday (10am-6pm) and Friday (10am-6pm) room FV329.

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Several computer exercises, 5 compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "devilry":"https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/" to hand in projects and "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: The last two projects (4 and 5) count 1/3 of the final mark each  and the  final written exam counts another 1/3 of the final grade. Final written exam December 14.
  * The computer lab (room FV329)consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. C/C++ is the default programming language, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics1" of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as languages.

===== Overarching aims of this course =====

  * Develop a critical approach to all steps in a project, which methods are most relevant, which natural laws and physical processes are important. Sort out initial conditions and boundary conditions etc.
  * This means to teach you structured scientific computing, learn to structure a project.
  * A critical understanding of central mathematical algorithms and methods from numerical analysis. In particular their limits and stability criteria.
  * Always try to find good checks of your codes (like solutions on closed form)
  * To enable you to develop a critical view on the mathematical model and the physics.
