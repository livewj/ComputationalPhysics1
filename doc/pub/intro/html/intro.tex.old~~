\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Several computer exercises, 5 compulsory projects. Electronic reports only.

\subsection{Overarching aims of this course}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop a critical approach to all steps in a project, which methods are most relevant, which natural laws and physical processes are important. Sort out initial conditions and boundary conditions etc.

  \item This means to teach you structured scientific computing, learn to structure a project.

  \item A critical understanding of central mathematical algorithms and methods from numerical analysis. In particular their limits and stability criteria.

  \item Always try to find good checks of your codes (like solutions on closed form)

  \item To enable you to develop a critical view on the mathematical model and the physics.

\subsection{A structured programming approach}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Before writing a single line, have the algorithm clarified and understood. It is crucial to have a logical structure of e.g., the flow and organization of data before one starts writing.

  \item Always try to choose the simplest algorithm. Computational speed can be improved upon later.

  \item Try to write a as clear program as possible. Such programs are easier to debug, and although it may take more time, in the long run it may save you time. If you collaborate with other people, it reduces spending time on debuging and trying to understand what the codes do. A clear program will also allow you to remember better what the program really does!
\end{itemize}

\noindent
% !split
\subsection{A structured programming approach}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The planning of the program should be from top down to bottom, trying to keep the flow as linear as possible. Avoid jumping back and forth in the program. First you need to arrange the major tasks to be achieved. Then try to break the major tasks into subtasks. These can be represented by functions or subprograms. They should accomplish limited tasks and as far as possible be independent of each other. That will allow you to use them in other programs as well.

  \item Try always to find some cases where an analytical solution exists or where simple test cases can be applied. If possible, devise different algorithms for solving the same problem. If you get the same answers, you may have coded things correctly or made the same error twice or more.
\end{itemize}
